# 🔺 Looping(Patterns)-Pascal's Triangle Generator in Python

This project demonstrates a simple Python program to generate **Pascal’s Triangle**, where the number of rows is provided by the user.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To write a Python program that generates **Pascal's Triangle** using numbers. The number of rows is accepted from the user.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Input the number of rows from the user.
3. Loop from 0 to the number of rows.
4. For each row:
   - Print appropriate spaces to shape the triangle.
   - Compute values using the formula:  
     \[
     C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
     \]
5. Print all rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
6. End the program.

## 🧪 Program
def pascal_triangle(n):
    trow = [1]
    y = [0]
    for x in range(max(n,0)):
        print(trow)
        trow=[l+r for l,r in zip(trow+y, y+trow)]
    return n>=1
n=int(input())
pascal_triangle(n)
