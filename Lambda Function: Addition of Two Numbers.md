# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a **lambda function** to define a function `f` that returns `a + b`.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## 🧾 Program
x=int(input())
y=int(input())
z=int(input())
expr = lambda x, y, z: (x * 10) + (y / 2) * z
print(expr(x, y, z))

## Result
Thus the Python program that defines a **lambda function** which takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns their sum was successfully completed
